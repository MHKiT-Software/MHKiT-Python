    "Environmental contours of extreme sea states can be used as a part of reliability-based design for offshore structures, including wave energy converters (WECs). Environmental contours provide estimations of extreme sea states based on short-term data (e.g. 10 years used to estimate a 100-year event). These environmental contours describe extreme sea states by characterizing the resource, defining sea states for extreme condition analysis, and developing a framework for analyzing survivability of a design.\n",

    "MHKiT includes functions adapted from the [WDRT](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WDRT) for creating environmental contours of extreme sea states using a principal component analysis (PCA) methodology, with additional improvements for characterizing the joint probability distribution of sea states. As a demonstration, this notebook will walk through the following steps to find a 100-year sea state for NDBC buoy 46022 using 16 years of spectral wave density data.\n",

The period will define a line of constant probability in the joint probability of $H_{m0}$ and $T_e$ but individually each component different reliability (marginal distribution) which we can find by evaluating a normal cumulative distribution function (CDF).

We can compare other copulas to our PCA method simply by adding more methods. A single string method can be applied if only one copula is of interest as was done above for the PCA method or multiple methods can be sent in using a list of strings. If mutiple methods of the same type are desired is recommended to run them at the same time if possible as it will reduce the computational expense by utilizing the common computational calls across the copulas. In the example below we will compare the parametric and nonparametric Gaussain contours to the PCA method we ran previously. \n",

E.g. if the `environmental_contours` function were called with the `'gaussian'` method then `environmental_contours` function would return a dictionary with keys `['gaussian_x1', 'gaussian_x2']`. The copula methods are a generalized mathematical method and therefore 'x1' and 'x2' are used in place of Hm0 and Te for the component values. 'x1' refers to the first array passed and 'x2' refers to the second array passed. In the example below 'x1' would refer to the Hm0 component of the coupla and 'x2' would refer to Te. "
